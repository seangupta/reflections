What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialise a repo, a folder .git is created holding the meta data of
	the repo. The new git repo is tied to a specific directory, with zero
	commits. You need to initialise a git repo because a directory is not
	automatically a git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Files are added to the staging area before a commit (which adds to the 
	repository). If a file is modified, at first only the file in the working
	directory changes. It needs to be added to the staging area before being
	committed to the repo. This serves the purpose that one might want to 
	further change modified files before these are finally committed. I.e. the
	staging area is an intermediate stage.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	All files that were modified for the logical change are added to the staging
	area. One can then use the command git diff to display the changes between the
	working directory and the staging area to verify that there is only one
	logical change, before committing.
