What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialise a repo, a folder .git is created holding the meta data of the repo. The new git repo is tied to a specific directory, with zero commits. You need to initialise a git repo because a directory is not automatically a git repo.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	You add files from the working directory to the staging area. You then create
	a commit of the files in this staging area. This commit then lives inside the 
	repository. The staging area allows you to keep modifying what files are to
	be added to a commit, before the actual commit is enshrined in (the git)
	history.
