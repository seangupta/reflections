When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I want to use a remote repository to collaborate with others, and to allow 
  users to download my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	experimentation without constantly having to account for changes others are
	pushing onto GitHub.
