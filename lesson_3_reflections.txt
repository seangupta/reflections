When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I want to use a remote repository to collaborate with others, and to allow 
  users to download my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might want to always pull changes manually in order to allow for local
	experimentation without constantly having to account for changes others are
	pushing onto GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Cloning means copying a repository including its commit history. This can be 
	done locally (local to local) or from the Github server to the local machine.
	If it is fone from the Github server to the Github server, it is called
	forking. Branching refers to creating a new branch in a repo, which can
	be done either locally or on the server.
