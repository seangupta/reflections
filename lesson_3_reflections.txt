When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  I want to use a remote repository to collaborate with others, and to allow 
  users to download my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You might want to always pull changes manually in order to allow for local
	experimentation without constantly having to account for changes others are
	pushing onto GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
one instead of another?

	Cloning means copying a repository including its commit history. This can be 
	done locally (local to local) or from the Github server to the local machine.
	If it is fone from the Github server to the Github server, it is called
	forking. Branching refers to creating a new branch in a repo, which can
	be done either locally or on the server.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored 
locally?

	If you are not able to access the Internet for a while (e.g. on a plane) then
	having a local copy of the remote is useful as it is the most up-to-date
	verion of the remote and one can take the most recent remote changes into
	account when making one's own local changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and 
what would be harder?

	Without using Git/GitHub, I would collaborate by saving drafts of new file
	versions and then comparing my new draft with others by doing an in-person
	review. This would be easier in the sense that one does not need to know
	the versioning technology, but harder because merge conflicts would be
	harder to resolve. It would also be harder to see who has changed what, and
	what the differences between different versions of a file are.
